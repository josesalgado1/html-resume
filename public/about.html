    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      My name's Jose. I'm your typical story of the college student who couldn't afford to finish of his degree. Initially,
      I started off as an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I was able to learn many concepts from the basics of physics in Engineering,
      to the molecular composition of materials, and most importantly, my first programming language. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I was first exposed to programming through MATLAB. Although not the most complex of conecpts, I finally discovered the process
      of thinking like a computer to write code. This sparked an interest, so I continued to pursue it through courses directing me
      towards a Computer Science minor, landing me in a C++ course. Through C++, I studied Data Structures and Algorithms furthing 
      my ability to understand how a computer "thinks." I was loving the abundance of information being thrown at me; I felt that I
      had the world at my fingertips. However, this all came screeching to an end when due to family matters, I was no longer able
      to afford my higher education pathway.

    <p>
      Feeling defeated, I returned to the retail worklife I'd always known. I remained in Colorado for a few more years with the
      hope that I may one day be able to continue my education. I worked a handful of jobs in the meantime to support the bare minimum
      lifestyle I had, none of which brought me fulfillment. After a couple of years doing so, I attempted my hail mary to continue 
      my education by applying for in-state tuition. After constant back and forth, the efforts rendered useless. The university denied
      my petition, and I decided to move back to my home state of Illinois. 
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, I decided I had to take matters into my own hands and continue my education myself. I took courses offered through
      Udemy and Coursera involving other programming languages such as Python and C. My efforts came to fruition in a sort when I 
      finally got my first tech position. I spent time as a contract ABAP Consultant working for Cognizant until my contract was up. <br />
      Fresh with experience, I tried to continue in the field. When nothing seemed to pan out, I decided to keep on going,
      bringing us to now. I've started my journey into web development while working in the insurance field to pay the bills. I hope
      to make this my long term lifestyle and solidify my position in the web development world!
    </p>

    <p>
      Enough of the life story, let me tell you who I am in my personal time. <br />
      I'm someone who loves to create. I challenge myself all the time to keep my creative mind fresh. I use outlets such as 
      writing, producing music, and creating new projects. I believe the best way to stay young, is to never stop learning.
      There is so much information to be learned in today's world, and I try my best to keep current. <br />
      Besides all that, I'm just a guy who loves a good meal shared by better company.
